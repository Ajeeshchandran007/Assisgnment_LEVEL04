🤔 Your question: Identify grounding techniques and their use cases

🔍 Querying: 'Identify grounding techniques and their use cases'

================================================================================
ANSWER:
================================================================================
Grounding techniques in the context of large language models (LLMs) include:

1. **Grounding with First-Party Enterprise Data**: This involves using data that is owned and generated by the enterprise itself to inform and enhance the outputs of generative AI models.

2. **Grounding with Third-Party Data**: This technique utilizes external data sources that are not owned by the enterprise but can provide valuable context or information to improve the model's responses.

3. **Grounding with World Data**: This refers to using publicly available information or general knowledge from the world to ground the outputs of generative AI models.

These grounding techniques help ensure that the generated outputs are relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate based on the data used.
